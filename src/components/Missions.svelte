		statement="Everyone learns in different ways. For the first time in history, we can analyze how millions
of people learn at once to create the most effective educational system possible and tailor it
to each student. Our ultimate goal is to give everyone access to a private tutor experience
through technology"

	<MissionCard
		title="Universally accessible."
		statement="There are over 1.2 billion people learning a language and the majority are doing so to gain
    access to better opportunities. Unfortunately, learning a language is expensive and
    inaccessible to most. We created Duolingo so that everyone could have a chance. Free language
    education â€“ no hidden fees, no premium content, just free. Duolingo is used by the richest man
    in the world and many Hollywood stars, and at the same time by public schools students in
    developing countries. We believe true equality is when spending more can't buy you a better
    education."
