		<h3>Universally accessible.</h3>
		<p>
			There are over 1.2 billion people learning a language and the majority are doing so to gain
			access to better opportunities. Unfortunately, learning a language is expensive and
			inaccessible to most. We created Duolingo so that everyone could have a chance. Free language
			education â€“ no hidden fees, no premium content, just free. Duolingo is used by the richest man
			in the world and many Hollywood stars, and at the same time by public schools students in
			developing countries. We believe true equality is when spending more can't buy you a better
			education.
